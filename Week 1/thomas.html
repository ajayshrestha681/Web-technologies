        <h1>Thomas J. Watson</h1>
        <p> Mr. Watson was born in Campbell, N.Y., February 17, 1874. His first job was at age 18 as 
            a bookkeeper in Clarence Risley's Market in Painted Post, N.Y. Later he sold sewing machines 
            and musical instruments before joining the National Cash Register Company as a salesman in 
            Buffalo.He eventually worked his way up to general sales manager. Bent on inspiring the dispirited 
             NCR sales force, Mr. Watson introduced the motto, "THINK," which later became a widely known 
             symbol of IBM.

            <li>A manager is an assistant to his men. </li>
            <li>Good design is good business.</li>
            <li>Design must reflect the practical and aesthetic in business but above all... good design must primarily serve people.</li>
            <li>You cannot stay in one place: you either go forward or you go backward</li>
            <li>If you want to increase your success rate, double your failure rate.</li>
            <li>Every time we've moved ahead in IBM, it was because someone was willing to take a chance, put his head on the block, and try something new.</li>
            <li>I was asked if I was going to fire an employee who made a mistake that cost the company $600,000. No, I replied, I just spent $600,000 training him. Why would I want somebody to hire his experience?</li>
            <li>Whenever an individual or a business decides that success has been attained, progress stops.</li>
            <li>It is easy to hear good tidings, but you have to scratch to get the bad news.</li>
            <li>And of course: THINK (All the problems of the world could be settled easily if men were only willing to think. The trouble is that men very often resort to all sorts of devices in order not to think, because thinking is such hard work.)</li>
